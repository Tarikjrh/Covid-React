# Covid-React

Covid Dashboard made with React.

# Interactive Map

This App contains an interactive map, where each country is color based on the number of cases it has and also, when you hover over a country, you can see the covid information of that country.
This was made with react-leaflet for the map management, and also i had to make a custom GeoJSON file with all the countries and latter on i merged the covid info to that GeoJSON file.

# Location Tracker

This App also has an IP tracker API, so that based on the user IP, it can determine the country of the user and display the current covid data of that country.

# Covid Ranks

This is a table that includes all the countries of the world that have covid cases and displays them.
User has the option of sorting the table, based on cases and confirmed deaths.

# Global Stats

In the final section of the app we can see the total global sum of cases.
